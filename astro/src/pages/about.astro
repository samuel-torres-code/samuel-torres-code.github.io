				<h1>
					I'm Sam.
				</h1>
				<p>
				 I am an engineer and amateur chef. I like to make things that serve people. 
				</p>
				Right now, I am taking a sabbatical to focus on personal projects. 
			
				<p>
				Previously, I worked on distributed systems at Netflix, built DJ software for KANM, developed learning tools at the TAMU Sketch Recognition Lab, improved safety initiatives at Arena Energy, and maintain multiplayer gaming servers for my friends. 
				</p>
				<p>
				I am interested in homelabs, fermentation, grilling, UX design, distributed systems, amateur radio, hifi sound systems, and leaving places better than I found them.
