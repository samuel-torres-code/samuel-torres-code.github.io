# Home Media Server

Built as a hobby project during Quarantine 2020

Still used by 20+ friends and family members

### What is it?

- My home server is a home lab built with spare computer parts.
- This server is used to host:
    - My large media collection
    - Servers for video games
    - Development environments
- Runs a Linux distro called OpenMediaVault
    - Uses Docker to host Plex, Minecraft Servers, SQL instances, etc.
    - Uses OpenVPN to allow me to tunnel into the server remotely

### Advantages over Hosting on my Main Computer

- Dedicated host for background tasks
    - Frees load off of my main computer

- Compartmentalized deployment of Docker containers
    - Simplifies instance management
    - Allows a wide variety of processes.
- Give new life to forgotten computer parts : )
