import ContainerGrid from "../../components/ContainerGrid.tsx";

`isabella` is the nickname for my home server that I run. She was built as a hobby project during _quarantine_ to host my media library, game servers and family photo albums.

The hardware is a computer build running in a closet connected to my parent's internet in Texas. I wanted to repurpose old computer parts, so I really only bought new hard drives.

The OS is `unraid` for it's ease of use for larger storage arrays, with a non-trivial amount of micro-services orchestrated through `docker` for information retrieval, catalogging, and serving.

The project is constantly evolving, so you can see the active docker containers below.
