# This is my website

I wrote this website to showcase my projects, thoughts and experiences. It uses Astro.js for the SSR and React for some interactive components. All art is drawn by me : )

Currently deployed on [https://samt.fyi](https://samt.fyi).

# Running locally

Use node 24.
`npm run dev`

# Build

`npm run build`

> This step is done automatically by the `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file when there are updates to the `main` branch.
